Project Description: Huffman Coding Text File Compression

Introduction:
Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to different characters in a text file, with the goal of representing frequently occurring characters with shorter codes and less frequent characters with longer codes. This project aims to implement Huffman coding for compressing text files, reducing their size while retaining all the original information.

Project Steps:

1. File Input:
   - The project begins by taking a text file as input. You can either specify the file path as a command-line argument or provide a file selection mechanism within your program.
   - Make sure to handle file reading and any potential errors that may occur during this step.

2. Frequency Calculation:
   - Once the input file is obtained, read its content and calculate the frequency of each character present.
   - Build a frequency table that records the occurrence count of each character.

3. Huffman Tree Construction:
   - Using the frequency table generated in the previous step, construct a Huffman tree.
   - The Huffman tree is a binary tree where each leaf node represents a character and its frequency, and each non-leaf node represents the combined frequencies of its children.
   - Construct the tree using a suitable algorithm such as the priority queue or a min-heap.

4. Code Generation:
   - Traverse the Huffman tree to assign unique binary codes to each character.
   - Assign shorter codes to characters with higher frequencies to achieve optimal compression.
   - Generate a code table that maps each character to its corresponding Huffman code.

5. File Compression:
   - Now that you have the Huffman codes, compress the original text file using these codes.
   - Replace each character in the text file with its corresponding Huffman code.
   - Pack the binary codes into bytes to ensure efficient storage.

6. Compressed File Output:
   - Write the compressed data, along with any additional information required for decompression, into a new file.
   - Include the Huffman tree structure or the code table in the compressed file to enable decompression.

7. File Decompression:
   - Implement the decompression algorithm to reverse the compression process.
   - Read the compressed file and reconstruct the Huffman tree or code table from the stored information.
   - Use the reconstructed data to convert the compressed codes back into the original text.

8. File Output:
   - Write the decompressed text into a new file, ensuring it matches the content of the original input file.
   - Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the decompression process.

Conclusion:
By implementing Huffman coding for text file compression, you will achieve a compressed representation of the original text file, reducing its size and allowing for efficient storage and transmission. This project provides an excellent opportunity to explore data compression techniques, tree data structures, and file handling operations.
